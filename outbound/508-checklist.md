# Digital Presentation 508 Checklist

## About

508 compliance refers to the standards outlined by [Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act](https://www.access-board.gov/about/law/ra.html), which mandates that electronic documents must be accessible to all, including people with disabilities. The OSPO seeks to make all our digital presentations, documents, and other electronic materials fully accessible and compliant with 508 standards.

Below is our process for making a slide presentation accessible:

## 508 Checklist

Based on [Create Accessible Presentations](https://www.section508.gov/create/presentations/)

In **Slides**, complete the following tasks:

| # | Module Name | Tasks | Completed? ✅ |
|---| :-----------| :-----| :-------------|
| 1 | [Creating the Presentation’s Layout Design and Establishing the Logical Reading Order](https://www.section508.gov/training/presentations/aed-cop-pptx01/) | <ul><li>Use the slide layout, themes and customized master slides to establish a logical reading order.</li><li>Use the selection pane to review the visual layout/reading order of the elements in each slide.</li></ul> | |
| 2 | [Ensuring the Contrast Ratio Between Text and Background is Sufficient](https://www.section508.gov/training/presentations/aed-cop-pptx02/) | <ul><li>When choosing the color palette for your slide’s design, close attention must be given to ensuring that there is enough color contrast between foreground and background.</li></ul> | |
| 3 | [Ensuring Color and Other Visual Characteristics that Convey Information are Also Described in Text](https://www.section508.gov/training/presentations/aed-cop-pptx03/) | <ul><li>Consider how color and other visual characteristics, such as size, shape, and location are used to convey meaning when creating your presentation.</li></ul> | |
| 4 | [Formatting Columns Correctly](https://www.section508.gov/training/presentations/aed-cop-pptx04/) | <ul><li>When modifying a slide’s layout, it may be necessary to structure content into columns. Ensure that content is read in the proper reading order by using the column tool.</li></ul> | |
| 5 | [Formatting Lists Properly](https://www.section508.gov/training/presentations/aed-cop-pptx05/) | <ul><li>Use lists to organize and structure content so that assistive technology can identify that information is contained in a group, and convey the relationship between each item within the list.</li></ul> | |
| 6 | [Using Built-In Features to Create Data Tables](https://www.section508.gov/training/presentations/aed-cop-pptx06/) |<ul><li>Use the built-in table features so that assistive technology can read data tables information in a meaningful manner.</li></ul> | |
| 7 | [Adding Alternative Text to Images and Other Objects](https://www.section508.gov/training/presentations/aed-cop-pptx07/) | <ul><li>Apply “alt text” to objects (images, pictures, images of text, images of tables, shapes, and icons with hyperlinks) to ensure equivalent access to the information.</li><li>Alt text should be short and to the point.</li><li>Alt text should communicate the same information as the visual content.</li><li>Alt text should refer to relevant content provided by the image, rather than simply describing how the image looks.</li><li>Alt text should not contain any extra or unnecessary information, and should not repeat information that is already provided in the text.</li><li>Alt text must be in the same language as the main content. For example, if you translate an English document into Spanish, you must also translate the alt text into Spanish.</li><li>If an image is purely decorative it’s helpful to label it as “decorative” or “ “, rather than adding an unnecessary description.</li></ul> | |
| 8 | [Creating Links with Unique and Descriptive Names](https://www.section508.gov/training/presentations/aed-cop-pptx08/) | <ul><li>Ensure all links have a unique URL or a unique descriptive name.</li><li>Avoid descriptions like “Link” or “Click here.”</li><li>By adding transparent text boxes with links to the front of a background image. Ensures hyperlinks rather than just visible URLs.</li><li>When possible avoid using images with embedded text.</li><li>Link descriptions can be added to the “Alt Text” feature.</li></ul> | |
| 9 | [Making Vital Background Information Accessible](https://www.section508.gov/training/presentations/aed-cop-pptx09/) | <ul><li>Make sure key details are clearly stated within the slide itself, using techniques like adding headers/footers, utilizing clear and concise text, providing alt text for images, maintaining sufficient color contrast, and checking the reading order to guarantee information is presented logically for screen readers.</li></ul> | |
| 10 | [Formatting Text for the Intended Language](https://www.section508.gov/training/presentations/aed-cop-pptx10/) | <ul><li>For presentations using multiple languages, use the language tool to programmatically set the presentation language to enable assistive technology to infer and correctly pronounce content.</li></ul> | |
| 11 | [Ensuring Descriptions of Embedded Audio, Video and Multimedia Files are Accurate](https://www.section508.gov/training/presentations/aed-cop-pptx11/) | <ul><li>Carefully name your media files with descriptive titles that clearly convey the content, and when necessary, add detailed captions or alternative text to explain what is being shown or heard.</li><li>Include key details like speaker names, topic, or location when relevant.</li><li>When adding images with embedded audio or video, provide alternative text that describes what is visually happening in the image alongside the audio or video content.</li></ul> | |
| 12 | [Excluding Flashing Objects](https://www.section508.gov/training/presentations/aed-cop-pptx12/) | <ul><li>Remove flashing objects from slides since they can cause seizures</li</ul>
| 13 | [Saving in the .pptx Format with a Descriptive Filename](https://www.section508.gov/training/presentations/aed-cop-pptx13/) | <ul><li>Use a descriptive file name to identify the document and its purpose so everyone can locate, open, and switch between documents.</li></ul> | |
| 14 | [Export the .pptx to a .pdf](https://www.section508.gov/create/pdfs/) | <ul><li>PDF files typically look the same on every device, and don't rely on dynamically loading things like typefaces or images from local systems. PDFs help preserve formatting, and limit usage of features like animations or transitions, that can be difficult to process in screenreaders or other accessibility tools.</li></ul> | |
