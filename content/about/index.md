## History of Open Source at CMS

The [Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)](https://www.cms.gov) has been an active supporter of and has utilized the [Open Source Software (OSS)](https://www.cms.gov/tra/Application_Development/AD_0200_Open_Source_Introduction.htm) on several IT projects for its mission-critical programs. Since 2015, several CMS business units and offices have been actively releasing OSS as part of IT modernization projects.

CMS has many active open source communities with hundreds of repositories across our many organizations (https://dsacms.github.io/metrics/organizations/). [Developer.cms.gov](https://www.developer.cms.gov) contains CMS' collection of APIs, datasets, frameworks, and style guides to develop applications that help people get the services and benefits they rely on
- [Beneficiary FHIR Data (BFD) Server](https://github.com/CMSgov/beneficiary-fhir-data): BFD Server is an internal backend to Medicare beneficiaries' demographic, enrollment, and claims data in FHIR format.
- [Beneficiary Claims Data API (BCDA)](https://bcda.cms.gov/): Enables Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) to retrieve Medicare Part A/B/D claims data for beneficiaries.
- [Data at the Point of Care API](https://dpc.cms.gov/): Enables making a patient's Medicare claims data available to healthcare providers for treatment purposes
- [AB2D API](https://ab2d.cms.gov/): Provides Prescription Drug Sponsors with secure Medicare parts A and B claims data for their plan enrollees
- [Blue Button 2.0](https://bluebutton.cms.gov/): Delivers Medicare Part A, B, and D data for over 60 million people with Medicare. Our most widely used and longest lived Open API projects.

CMS has embraced Open Source development and is looking forward to releasing more software to the community to promote reuse. 


## CMS Open Source Strategy

Based on the goals outlined in the Federal Source Code Policy/OMB directive M-16-21, the CMS Open Source Policy was written in 2018 to promote transparency, collaboration, and reuse of government-funded software in support of healthcare solutions: https://github.com/CMSgov/cms-open-source-policy 

The [CMS Technical Reference Architecture](https://dsacms.github.io/ospo-guide/about/tra/ ) also contains more information and guidance on using and releasing open source software.

## CMS Open Source Program Office

An open source program office (OSPO) serves as the center of competency for an organization's open source operations and structure. It is responsible for defining and implementing strategies and policies to guide these efforts. The function of the CMS OSPO is: 
> “Establish and maintain guidance, policies, practices, and talent pipelines that advance equity, build trust, and amplify impact across CMS, HHS, and Federal Open Source Ecosystems by working and sharing openly.”
