##### [FAQs](#faqs)

## GitHub Organization Access

### Request a new team to be created for a Project

#### Step 1: Creating a Team with Project Maintainers - Maintainers Team

Project maintainers will be placed in their own separate team and serve as the main point of contact for coordinating team & repository management with the OSPO.

Information required:

- GitHub username
- Team name

### Request a new repo to be created

If you are looking to migrate an existing repository hosted in a different organization into a new repository under DSACMS, the new repository will be created as private by default. In order for your repository to be released as public, please follow our [outbound review checklist](https://github.com/DSACMS/ospo-guide/blob/main/outbound/OUTBOUND_CHECKLISTS.md) for your project’s maturity tier.

If you are looking to create a completely new repository, your repository can be created as private or public. Based on the maturity model tier selected, a collection of [markdown templates](https://github.com/DSACMS/ospo-guide/blob/main/outbound/REPOSITORY_TEMPLATES_AND_LINTERS.md) will be included as part of our repository hygiene standards. GitHub security features such as Dependabot and secret scanning will be enabled.

Information required:

- Repository Name
- Repository Description
- Project’s [Maturity Model Tier](https://github.com/DSACMS/repo-scaffolder/blob/main/maturity-model-tiers.md)

[https://github.com/organizations/DSACMS/settings/security_products](https://github.com/organizations/DSACMS/settings/security_products)

- All repositories use the GitHub-recommended code security configuration:
  {% image_with_class "assets/resources/img/github-management-policy/code_security_configurations.png" "" "GitHub Code Security Configurations" %}

- Currently, all public repositories under DSACMS use GitHub Advanced Security
  features (i.e. Code Scanning, Secret Scanning). Private repositories will only have
  free features enabled.

### FAQs

##### Can I be admin for a repository?

For now, no. Admin is only reserved for OSPO staff but as we continue to use this organization and form our GitHub policy guidance, this may change in the future.

##### How do GitHub Teams work? What are the differences between parent teams and child teams?

- Teams can only be made up of members of your organization, outside collaborators are unable to be on a team.
- You should give parent teams repository access permissions that are safe for every member of the parent team and its child teams. As you move toward the bottom of the hierarchy, you can grant child teams additional, more granular access to
  more sensitive repositories.

##### Can we add outside collaborators as code reviewers?

Yes! `MAINTAINERS.md` in the repository’s root directory is the ‘source of truth’ for this list of users. This file can be updated indirectly by creating an issue as noted in the outside collaborator section, or directly by creating a Pull Request with Name and github username for the collaborator under the `Reviewers` section. Once this list is updated, a repository admin can grant appropriate levels of access upon request in #cms-ospo or by filing a ticket.
