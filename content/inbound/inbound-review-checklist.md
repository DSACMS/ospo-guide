## **Existing Products and Alternatives**

According to Section 3.1 of the Source Code Policy:

In meeting their software needs, covered agencies must conduct \[a\] [three-step analysis](https://code.gov/agency-compliance/compliance/procurement/) \[…\] intended to leverage existing solutions – consistent with principles of category management and shared services – and suitable commercial solutions, while mitigating unnecessary spending on custom-developed software solutions.

### Conduct Strategic Analysis and Analyze Alternatives

It is important to conduct strategic analysis and alternatives analysis to determine whether to use an existing Federal software solution or to acquire or develop a new software solution.

**According to BR-OSS-1, products in use at CMS that provide the required functionality are preferred.** CMS prefers mature COTS and OSS products that have demonstrated successful implementation at or outside of CMS. The benefits must outweigh the risks of using new or unproven products. Like custom code, CMS business owners using OSS in a CMS application are responsible for its maintenance.

When evaluating alternatives, consider the following:

#### Existing CMS-approved software

- Are there other OSS or COTS products in use at CMS that can serve the same purpose as the OSS?

#### Commercial Solutions

- COTS can be extended through custom code to satisfy your requirements, however this can become [difficult and costly to maintain](https://guides.18f.gov/derisking-government-tech/software-solutions/#why-to-avoid-umots-or-beware-customizing-cots).

#### Custom Software

- Having determined that no Federal or commercial solutions exist that completely meet their needs, consider building or buying custom software.

#### Resources

- [18F guide on understanding and choosing a software solution](https://guides.18f.gov/derisking-government-tech/software-solutions/)

The project teams at CMS are recommended to conduct market research and analyze commercial and other open-source alternatives that may meet their business needs. For your preferred solution along with each alternative considered, fill out the table below:

## **Software Evaluation \[BR-OSS-2\]**

Finding the right OSS that meets CMS’s needs requires assessing the maturity of the software and the level of support provided by the community involved in the OSS project. Evaluate the software based on the criteria below according to BR-OSS-2:

_When assessing each criterion, be sure to flag any potential risks found._

| Criteria                     | Questions                                                                                                                                                                                         | Response |
| :--------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :------- |
| Market Share                 | What is the OSS’s market / industry rate of adoption?                                                                                                                                             |          |
| Credibility                  | What is the position of OSS’ structured bodies and organizations?                                                                                                                                 |          |
| Maintenance                  | Is the software actively maintained? When was the last activity?                                                                                                                                  |          |
| Documentation                | Are there comprehensive and readily available documentation such as markdown files hosted on repositories, release notes, instruction manuals, documentation websites?                            |          |
| Community                    | Is there an active online community behind the OSS? Are there any commercial conflicts? What is the composition of the community (e.g. commercial organizations, government agencies)?            |          |
| Source Code Quality          | Does the open source project routinely use source code inspection tools to assess quality and security of the source code? Is the code well documented? Does an independent body review the code? |          |
| Rate of Change               | What is the rate of change of the OSS? This includes the rate of code change and the rate of new releases.                                                                                        |          |
| Bug & Tracking Vulnerability | Is there a bug / vulnerability reporting and resolution system? How quickly are patches issued to resolve them?                                                                                   |          |
| Productization               | Refer to [Considerations](#considerations) section                                                                                                                                                |          |

### Notes on Productization

CMS is especially interested in the degree to which the OSS is “productized” (in comparison to COTS), which encompasses much of these three criteria. Although most OSS is only partially productized, information is available to support productization. **CMS’s primary concern is assessing the burden to overcome the lack of productization and determining whether the benefits outweigh the risks in this regard.** Initially, CMS will only consider OSS that has third-party vendor support for productization (Red Hat, for example, is a third-party vendor that offers an “enterprise-ready” distribution of Linux (an open source operating system platform) along with associated support, training, and consulting services).

#### Considerations

- Does the project directly provide or offer support contracts for this product?
- Is there a 3rd party vendor who provides or offers support contracts for this product?
- Is the product released on a regular cadence or release schedule?
- Does the product use ‘releases’ on GitHub or other distribution platforms?
- Is there training available (paid or free) for this product? If yes, please add URLs.
- Does CMS already pay for or contract with a vendor who supports this product?
- If a subscription lapses, does CMS continue to have access to the product as it is, or do we lose access to the system?
- Do any other agencies or operational divisions use this product in a production system?

## **Total Cost of Ownership \[BR-OSS-3\]**

For CMS, reducing cost is relevant and a valid driver for using OSS. According to BR-OSS-3, the agency must determine the total cost of ownership and the risks of using open source as a solution before adopting or authorizing adoption of OSS for a CMS project.

It will be CMS’s responsibility to ensure that all subsequent government estimates and/or contractor quotes clearly show a detailed breakout of costs associated with using the OSS.

### Cost Types

**Evaluation Costs**: OSS must be installed and evaluated locally to assess its use within the enterprise.

**Maintenance Costs**: IT departments must define and implement a strategy to manage the OSS once installed, such as installing patches and upgrades.

**Installation and Configuration Costs**: Installation and configuration of OSS can be time consuming. Effective installation and configuration depend heavily on the organization’s skill level in using open source development tools, system administration, and operations.

**Integration and Customization Costs**: Open source projects may not be designed to operate within enterprise IT infrastructure. IT departments may have to integrate and customize OSS to suit their environments.

**Operations & Support Costs**: Addressed in the [License Compatibility](#license-compatibility-br-oss-4) section

| Assessment                                                                                                                             | Cost Type                    | Response |
| :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------- | :------- |
| Describe how you will specifically configure and use the software/application.                                                         | Installation & Configuration |          |
| How well will the OSS integrate within CMS’s environment? Is customization of the OSS required?                                        | Integration & Customization  |          |
| Are any other applications required for this software to operate? Are there any special integrations into the other software required? | Integration & Customization  |          |
| Describe how maintenance will be conducted                                                                                             | Maintenance                  |          |
| Does CMS have adequate resources to support development, operations, and maintenance for the OSS?                                      | Maintenance                  |          |

## **License Compatibility \[BR-OSS-4\]**

When selecting OSS, CMS must ensure that the associated OSS license is consistent with CMS’s objectives and environment. The TRB is responsible for approval of OSS licenses within the [CMS Open Source Policy](https://github.com/CMSgov/cms-open-source-policy).

### Licensing Model / Compliance

## **Security Assessment**

To evaluate the risks associated with using the software, our software approval and assurance process incorporates thorough checks focused on security, integrity, dependencies, potential malicious activity, and long-term project support. Leveraging tools like OpenSSF Scorecard and MITRE Hipcheck, we identify and flag potential concerns for further investigation by our product and security teams.

### Compliance with Federal & Agency Security Policies

Are there CMS or federal security policies that prohibit the use of the OSS? Does the OSS product allow implementation of CMS or federal security requirements?

### Software Composition Analysis

1. Generate a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) (see: [https://www.cisa.gov/sbom](https://www.cisa.gov/sbom) for more details)
   1. If project is on GitHub, you can find and export the SBOM in the repository insights page: github.com/\<REPO*\>*/network/dependencies
   2. If the project is not on GitHub, you can use a tool like pysyft to generate an SBOM too.
2. Use tools in the toolkit below to ingest the SBOM and create reports providing detailed information of the software composition

### Run and Review OpenSSF Scorecard

The [OpenSSF Scorecard](https://securityscorecards.dev/#what-is-openssf-scorecard) assesses security risks and community security practices of the software through a series of automated checks. The scorecard checks for vulnerabilities affecting different parts of the software supply chain including source code, build, dependencies, testing, and project maintenance.

#### Determining which scorecard minimums to use

- Is it a web-facing project?
- Does it allow for user input?
- Is it written in a memory unsafe language like C or C++?
- Is it packaged and released on a distribution site like pypi, npm, crates, etc…?

#### Instructions

1. Run the scorecard on the software repository [using the CLI](https://securityscorecards.dev/#using-the-cli).
2. Report the scores in the table below. Check whether they pass the minimum.
