According to the [TRA](https://www.cms.gov/tra/Application_Development/AD_0200_Open_Source_Introduction.htm) it is recommended that,
“For CMS projects using OSS, each CMS business owner is responsible for assuring that CMS’s use of the open source is according to license. For a CMS-released OSS project, the CMS business owner is responsible for selecting an appropriate license model. In either case, the TRB is responsible for approval of OSS licenses.Be aware of licensing issues and select a licensing model considering the difference between “permissive” and “non-permissive” licenses, warranty / guarantee limitations, attribution, and trademark / IP protections and its impact on the choice of license.”

You can find a list of [OSI Approved Licenses here](https://opensource.org/license). More information about the TRA open source licensing section is [here](https://www.cms.gov/tra/Application_Development/AD_0220_Open_Source_Strategy.htm#:~:text=Open%20Source%20Licensing).
